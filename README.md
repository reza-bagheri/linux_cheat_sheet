# A comprehensive Linux Cheat Sheet
I have created a comprehensive cheat sheet that breaks down some of the most useful Linux commands by category. The most useful options have been presented for each command and additionally, there are examples of how to use them. A few categories involve brief explanations about the underlying Linux concepts that should be understood before using the given commands. I, for instance, have elaborated on what the Linux permission bits mean before talking about permissions-related commands. Similarly, there is a simple explanation of concepts like the Linux filesystem, hierarchical directory structure, inodes and hard links, processes and jobs, shell sessions, and regular expression. Simplification was my goal while writing this text. With 41 pages, this cheat sheet is likely the most comprehensive one ever made for Linux commands. Anyone who wishes to review or learn the most important commands in Linux might benefit from it.
